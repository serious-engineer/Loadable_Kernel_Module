# First LKM (Loadable Kernel Module)

This repository contains a simple example of a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) for Linux, demonstrating basic interactions with the `/proc` filesystem through custom read and write handlers. It is designed for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel programming concepts.

---

## Features

- **Custom `/proc` entry**: Creates a `/proc/driver_name` node.
- **Read functionality**: Returns the contents of a kernel buffer or a default message ("Acknowledge\n") when read.
- **Write functionality**: Updates the kernel buffer with data from user space.
- **Kernel logging**: Logs actions to the kernel message buffer using `printk`.

---

## Files

- **Source Code**: `ldd.c`
  - Implements the LKM, including initialization, cleanup, and `/proc` entry operations.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Linux system with kernel development tools installed.
- Kernel headers for the currently running kernel.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Build the Module**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Insert the Module**:
   ```bash
   sudo insmod driver_name.ko
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   Check the kernel message log for initialization messages:
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail -n 20
   ```

---

## Usage

### Read Data from `/proc/driver_name`:
```bash
cat /proc/driver_name
```

### Write Data to `/proc/driver_name`:
```bash
echo "Your message" > /proc/driver_name
```

---

## Cleanup

1. **Remove the Module**:
   ```bash
   sudo rmmod driver_name
   ```

2. **Verify Removal**:
   Check the kernel message log for cleanup messages:
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail -n 20
   ```

---

## Development Notes

### Kernel Logs
Use `dmesg` to view logs generated by `printk` statements in the module.

### Permissions
The `/proc/driver_name` node is created with `0666` permissions, allowing both read and write access to all users.
